# Projectile Simulation Engine

Projectile Simulation Engine is a cloud-deployed backend service for computing and visualizing projectile motion trajectories.

## Overview

The backend performs synchronous trajectory computations per request using physics-based formulas and time-step iteration. The service is exposed via Spring Boot REST APIs and deployed on Azure infrastructure.

## Architecture

- Stateless REST API built with Spring Boot  
- Synchronous numerical trajectory computation  
- Coordinate generation per request  
- Docker containerization  
- Azure-hosted deployment  

## Core Capabilities

- High-frequency coordinate computation  
- Parameter-based trajectory simulation  
- Backend-driven numerical processing  
- Cloud-deployed containerized service  

The project focuses on backend computation accuracy and service deployment rather than front-end-heavy visualization.
